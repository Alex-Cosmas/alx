# assignment

**Context**
This is a submission for an take home assignment. The goal was to develop a web based application (which is mobile friendly).  The application was not to be hardcoded but instead use JSON Objects to hold and update the data to the components within a week.

The UI designs didn't have the full designs but especially for the form, so it was safe to assume one is expected to build a form that will create, update or delete the data from the app. 

The was an option to use a framework, preferably VueJS Framework. I opted to go with NuxtJS and TailwindCSS based on the timeline and unfamiliarity with Quasar. 

I decided to group the project in smaller section and tackle them as follows. 

**Breakdown**

- Design the layout
- JSON Objects 
- Creating methods and binding to the designs
- Tackle styling responsiveness
- Refactor code into smaller components
- Styling and cleaning up


## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```
